WARC Indexer
============

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1013711589.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18183415)

Latest release 3.4.0: https://github.com/netarchivesuite/warc-indexer/releases/tag/3.4.0

This code runs Apache Tika on WARC and ARC records and extracts suitable metadata for indexing.

It is set up to work with Apache Solr, and our schema is provided in src/main/solr. The tests are able to spin-up an embedded Solr instance to verify the configuration and regression-test the indexer at the query level.

Using this command, it can also builds a suitable command-line tool for generating/posting Solr records from web archive files.

    $ mvn clean install

Which runs like this:

    $ java -jar target/warc-indexer-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    -s http://localhost:8080/ \
    src/test/resources/wikipedia-mona-lisa/flashfrozen-jwat-recompressed.warc.gz

TBA configuration HOW TO.

To print the default configuration:

    $ java -cp target/warc-indexer-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar uk.bl.wa.util.ConfigPrinter

To override the default with a new configuration:

    $ java -jar target/warc-indexer-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -Dconfig.file=new.conf \
    -s http://localhost:8080/ \
    src/test/resources/wikipedia-mona-lisa/flashfrozen-jwat-recompressed.warc.gz


Note that this project also contains short ARC and WARC test files, taken from the [warc-test-corpus]
